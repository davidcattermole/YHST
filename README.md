# You Hosting Starter Theme
After lurking on the forums for some time it came to my attention that some people were a little stuck and didn't know where to begin. YHST was created to give a simple, responsive base for users to build their hosting on. 

The instructions below, and the whole theme itself for that matter was targeted at beginners, so I apologise if it seems patronising at all.

At the moment YHST does not include styles for the Control Panel and login pages. If there is enough interest this can change.

#### What YHST is
* An HTML template with a little added PHP to make it easier to set up
* Built on Twitter Bootstrap and HTML5 Boilerplate
* Responsive down to mobile screens

#### What YHST isn't
* A WordPress theme
* A forum theme
* Ready to go without any modification

### What's in the box?
* A home page with three featured hosting packages, information about your services and a sliding testimonial section
* A features page detailing your three plans and an overview of the technical features of your hosting
* An about page to tell customers about your company
* A contact page which includes the public ticket form

## Quick Start
1. Download the zipped archive
2. Upload it to the root of your master domain
3. Extract the files
4. Use a text editor to edit /includes/config.php 
5. Edit the HTML of the pages to suit your hosting plans and company

## Detailed Instructions
Setting the theme up on your site is easy. If you know some HTML then great, but if not, don't worry, you can learn form the code in the templates — it' s easier than you think.

First of all, download a zipped archive of YSHT and upload it to the root of your master domain (either through the Control Panel file managers or FTP — whichever you feel more comfortable with).
